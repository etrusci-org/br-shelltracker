# br-shelltracker

A helper tool for the game [Buckshot Roulette](https://criticalreflex.io/buckshot_roulette).

Too baked to remember how many live and blank shells there are left?  
Just click `+` or `âˆ’` to update the displayed counts and chances whenever the shotgun is reloaded, a shell is used, ejected, or its polarity is flipped.

## Usage

To use it, open [dist/index.html](./dist/index.html) in a webbrowser.  
I host the latest release on <https://etrusci.org/tool/br-shelltracker>.

**But you can also self-host it if you like.** To do so follow these steps:

**1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/etrusci-org/br-shelltracker/releases).**  
In the **Assets** dropdown, download either the **zip** or **tar.gz** file and save it to your computer.

**2. Unpack the just downloaded file.**  
   You should now see a new folder that was unpacked.  
   Inside that folder should be another folder named **dist** with an **index.html** file inside.

![indexfile](./doc/3-indexfile.png)

**3. Double-click **dist/index.html** to open it with your default webbrowser,** or right-click it, then choose *open-with...* from the context menu if you do not want to use your default webbrowser.

The tool should now be opened in your webbrowser and ready to use.
